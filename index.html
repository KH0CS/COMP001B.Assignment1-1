  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>

  <div class="p">
  <p>What do you hope to learn in your CSS course?</p>
  </div>
    <p> I hope to learn the basics and get a good foundation in CSS. That's the least I can hope for, something that will get my foot in the door with this.</p>
    <p>Something I hope to learn is understanding the hows & whys certain things work in CSS so I can know when to use them., and why I am using them.</p>
    <p>I would also like to learn the best way to make the all integrate together seamlessly, so that when I do make my own project I am comfortable with doing so. </p>
